# Contributing to MLtune

Thanks for contributing! This is an open source project made by one high schooler, so please be patient if code reviews or responses take some time.

## Quick Workflow

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a branch** - Use naming convention: `feat/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name`
3. **Make focused commits** - One logical change per commit
4. **Run tests and linters** locally before pushing
5. **Push your branch** and open a Pull Request
6. **Address review feedback** - Rebase/squash if requested

## Before Contributing

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
- Keep changes small and focused
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for user-facing changes

## Commit Message Format

Use this format for commit messages:

```
<type>(scope): short imperative summary

Body (optional):
- Explain what changed and why
- Include "from X → Y" for value changes
- Note testing and compatibility
```

### Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Code style (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc.)

### Examples

**Good commit:**
```
feat(optimizer): reduce default learning_rate 0.01 → 0.001

Changed Adam (adaptive moment estimate) default learning_rate in 
MLtune/optimizer.py from 0.01 → 0.001.

Why: Reduced overshooting and improved stability on noisy datasets.
Testing: Updated tests/test_optimizer.py::test_default_lr to assert new default.
Files: MLtune/optimizer.py, tests/test_optimizer.py
```

**Bad commit:**
```
fix stuff
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what this PR does.

## Changes
- List specific changes made
- Use "from X → to Y" format for value changes
- Explain why changes were needed

## Testing
- Describe how you tested
- Include relevant test output
- Note any manual testing performed

## Related Issues
- Closes #123
- Relates to #456
```

### Good PR Example

**Title:** `feat(optimizer): improve convergence detection`

**Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
Improves convergence detection by adding standard deviation threshold check.

## Changes
- Added `std_threshold` parameter to optimizer convergence check
- Changed convergence from "no improvement in 5 iterations" to 
  "no improvement in 5 iterations AND std < threshold"
- Default std_threshold = 0.01

Why: Previous method sometimes detected false convergence on noisy data.

## Testing
- Updated tests/test_optimizer.py::test_convergence
- Ran manual test with noisy synthetic data
- Verified convergence is more stable

## Related Issues
Closes #42
```

## Code Style

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to public functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_score(hit: bool, distance: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate shot score based on hit result and distance.
    
    Args:
        hit: Whether shot hit target
        distance: Distance to target in meters
        
    Returns:
        Score value (0.0 to 1.0)
    """
    if hit:
        return 1.0
    return max(0.0, 1.0 - distance / 10.0)
```

### Java Style

- Follow WPILib conventions
- Use `m_` prefix for member variables
- Use `k` prefix for constants
- Use `s_` prefix for static fields
- Add Javadoc comments

### Running Linters

```bash
# Python
black MLtune/tuner/
flake8 MLtune/tuner/

# Check formatting without changing
black --check MLtune/tuner/
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cd MLtune/tuner
python run_tests.py

# Specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_optimizer.py -v

# With coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when changing behavior
- Mock external dependencies (NetworkTables)
- Use descriptive test names

**Example:**
```python
def test_optimizer_clamps_to_bounds():
    """Test that optimizer suggestions are clamped to configured bounds."""
    config = CoefficientConfig(min=0.0, max=1.0, default=0.5)
    optimizer = BayesianOptimizer(config)
    
    suggestion = optimizer.suggest_next_value()
    
    assert suggestion >= 0.0
    assert suggestion <= 1.0
```
